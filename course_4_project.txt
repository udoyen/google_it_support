Company Name: W. D. Widgets:

Process Improvment #1:
    - Problem: Install lots of sales-specific applications manually onto every machine.
    - Solution: Setup a GPO (Group Policy Object) that will install these applications as part of the defult setup for sales department employees.
    - Reasoning:

      the email server, local machine software, and instant messenger. None of the company's services are kept on the cloud.
    - Solution: Moved some of the in-house application to the cloud to cut cost of onpremise hosting of such applications.
    - Reasoning:
        -- For a smale organization on a tight budget it would be very cost efficeint to move some of their
            applications (hosted in-house) to the cloud where they can be better managed.

    - Problem: Customer data is stored on a single file server.
    - Solution: Put in place a proper data backup and recovery solution using afforadable online storage.
    - Reasoning:

            data storage solution that will ensure data backup and recovery as this is usually standard 
            with most of these online storage services.

Process Improvement #5:
    - Problem: Expected company expansion predicted to affected current IT operations.

Company Name: Dewgood

Process Improvement #1:
    - Problem:  Computers are purchased directly in a physical store on the day that 
                an employee is hired. This is due to budget reasons, as they can't keep 
                extra stock in the store.
    - Solution: Setup and implement a proper hardware lifecycle managment system.
    - Reasoning:
        -- Using a proper hardware lifecycle system the company will be able to manage it's computer fleet,
            keep track and reuse any for new emplyees saving them cost.

Proess Improvement #2:
    - Problem: They don't currently have a messaging system in place.
    - Solution: Use an open source IM tool to help improve internal communication and collaboration.
    - Reasoning:
        -- Using tools like NC which is an open source IM tool for team collaboration will help improve
            internal company communications.

Process Improvement #3:
    - Problem: You're also responsible for installing all the software they need on their 
        machine, and mapping the file server to their computer.
    - Solution: Use GPO (Group Policy Objects) in active directory to automate the installation process
                and map file server to staff computers automatically.

Process Improvement #4:
    - Problem: When an employee leaves, they're currently not disabled in the directory service.
    - Solution: Use the AD to setup OUs (Organizational Units) to make adding and removing users, and groups
                 more easy and automate the process.
    - Reasoning:
        -- Using OUs group policies can be created that will target specific users and make the process
            of removing such users easy.

Process Improvement #5:
    - Problem: There are nightly backups in place of the file server. You store this 
                information on a disk backup and take it home with you everyday.
    - Solution: Implement a cloud based backup solution with affordable providers.
    - Reasoning:
        -- Since the company is non-profit and cash-strapped it would be better to use an affordable online storage solution, and this will ensure that the risks involved in carrying the backup home
            everyday will be removed.
