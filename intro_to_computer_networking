Course Intro:
    - Protocol:
        -- a defined set of standards that computers must follow in order to communicate properly.
    - Computer networking:
        -- the name we've given to the full scope of how computers communicate with each other.
    - TCP/IP 5 layer communication model:

    - Layers:
        -- Physical layer:
            -- Represents the physical devices that interconnect computers:
                -- specifications for the networking cables
                -- connectors that connect devices
                -- specifications on how signal are sent over this cables
        -- Data Link layer ( network interface or the network access layer):
                -- introduce protocols
                -- defines the way signals are interpreted using protocols so computers understand
                -- protocol example protocol is the Ethernet
                    -- defines the protocol standards responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.
        -- Network Layer (internet layer):
                -- Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers.
                -- Note: A collection of networks connected together through routers are known as Internetwork, the most 
                    famous of these being the Internet.
                -- responsible for getting data delivered across a collection of networks.
                -- Most common protocol here is the IP.
        -- Transport Layer:
                -- Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data from the network layer
                -- TCP/UDP; (User Datagram Protocol)
        -- Application Layer:
                -- This receives and send the data.


    -- NOTE:
        In addition to the five layer model we are working with, it\u2019s important to note that other models exist. The traditional TCP/IP Model only has four layers, as it doesn\u2019t differentiate between the physical layer and the data link layer, but is otherwise very similar to the one we\u2019ll be working with. The most well known other model is the OSI model. It\u2019s the model taught by many other networking certificate programs, like Net+ and Cisco\u2019s many networking certifications. The primary difference between our five layer model and the seven layer OSI model is that the OSI model abstracts the application layer into three layers total.

The Basics of Networking Devices:
    - Cables:
        -- Connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them.
        -- Types: Copper and fiber
            -- Copper Cable:
                - types include: Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cabbles
        -- Crosstalk:
            -- this is when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire.
            -- Fiber cables:
                -- Contain individual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of human hair.
    - Hubs and Switches:
        The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN, 
        or local area network.
        -- Hubs:
            - Belongs to Physical Layer
            - A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once
            - produces much noice creating Collison Domain
                - Collision Domain:
                    - A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time. 
        -- Switch or Network Switch:
            - Belongs to the Data Link layer
            - An improvement on hubs
            - inspects ethernet data to determine where each packet should go
            
    - Routers:
        -- A device that knows how to forward data between independent networks
        -- Belongs to Layer 3
        -- inspects IP addresses and determine where each packet should go.
        -- Use routing table to determine where things are sent.
        - Core Router:
            -- used by ISPs to connect networks over a huge area.
            -- Use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to share data with each other, which lets them learn about the 
                most optimal paths to forward traffic.

    - Servers and Clients:

The Physical Layer:
    - Consists of devices and means of transmitting bits across computer networks
    - Line Coding === Modulation === Varying electrical signals passing through a coper cable during signal transmission
    - Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplex
        - helps prevent cross-talk and electromagnetic interference
        - Composition:
            -- Cat6 wire == 8 wires in twisted 4 pairs in on jacket
        - enablee duplex communication: which makes it possible to have data flow in both directions
    - NOTE: 
        -> Simple communication is unidirectional
        -> A full two way communication is called Full-duplex
        -> Half-duplex: here only one device can communicate at a time
    - Ethernet over twisted pair technologies are the communications protocols that determine how much data can be sent over a twisted pair cable, how quickly that data can be sent, and how long a network cable can be before the data quality begins to degrade.

    - Network ports and patch panel:
        -- Most common plug used to expose network wires is: RJ45 (Registered Jack 45) which has a corresponding port on the device
        -- Diagram of a RJ45 port:

    - Device connection setup:
        -- Device ==> Network Ports ==> Patch Panels ===> routers / switches (provides network access to the devices at the other end)

The Data Link Layer:
    - The ethernet protocol is used to send data across individual links
    - CSMA/CD: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection, is used by ethernet to detect collision and prevent it. Used to determine when communication channels are clear, and when a device is free to transmit data.
    - Media Access Controll Address or MAC Address:
        -- it's a 48-bit number normally represented by six groupings of two hexadecimal numbers.
            -- Hexadecimal ( or Base 16) numbers are: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F, 
            -- an example would be 12:ED:34:78:FA:AD
    - Another way to represent MAC addresses is using Octet which are any number that can be represented by 8 bits.
    - MAC Address composition:
        -- The first three octets of a MAC address is known as the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), used to identify the organization that owns the MAC device
        --

    - NOTE: Ethernet uses MAC addresses to ensure that data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the transmission, 
            as well as the one the transmission was intended for.

    - Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast:
        -- Unicast:
            -- Transmission of data from one device to just another one device
            -- Transmission is always meant for just one receiving address
            -- Determined by the rule that says:
                ::if the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to zero, 
                    it means that ethernet frame is intended foronly the destination address.
        -- Multicast:
            -- Determined by the rule that says:
                :: if the least significant bit in the first octet os a destination address is set to one, 
                    it means you're dealing with a multicast frame
        -- Broadcast:
            -- Determined using a special address:
                :: The address is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

    - Dissectin An Ethernet Frame:
        -- Data packet:
            -- An all-encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link
            -- Data packets at the Ethernet level are known as Ethernet Frames.
            -- Ethernet frames: A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order.

            -- Ethernet Frames structure:
               
                Preamble                        Source Address    Ether-type                            FCS
                  8 bytes                          6 bytes         2 bytes                            4 bytes

            -- Preamble: 8 bytes)=(or 64bits) long, and can be split into two sections:
                -- Sections:    
                    -- 7 bytes:> alternating ones and zeros which act partially as buffers between frames and are used as internal clocks to regulate speed
                                at which data is sent.
                    -- 1 byte:> SFD ==: Start Frame Delimiter. It signals to a receiving device that the preamble is over and that the actual frame contents will soon follow.
            -- Destination and Source Address: destination and source of data. 
            -- EtherType field:
                -- 16 bits long and used to describe the protocol of the contents of the frame
            -- Tag or VALN Tag:
                -- Indicates that the frame itself is what's called a VLAN frame.
                    --- VLAN: A technique that lets you have multiple logical LANs operating on the same physical equipment.
            -- Payload:
                -- Is the actual data being transported, which is everything that isn't a header. Length 46 - 1500 bytes long and contains layers 3 - 5 in the TCP/IP layer module.
            -- FCS: Frame Check Sequence
                - A 4 byte ( or 32 bit) number that represents a checksum value for the entire frame
                - This checksum value is calculated by performing what's known as a cyclical redundancy check against the frame.
                - CRC (Cyclical Redundancy Check) is an important concept used for data integrity, and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions. 

The Network Layer:
    - IP Datagram and Encapsulation:
        -- Here packets are known as IP datagram
        -- IP Datagram: This is a highly structured series of fields that are strictly defined.

        NOTE: THIS SECTIO IS THE PAYLOAD SECTION IN THE ETHERNET FRAME


        -- Sections of the IP Datagram:
            -- Version: indicates the version of the ip protocol being e.g. IPv4
            -- Header: 4 bit, declares how long the field is. 20 bytes in length when dealing with IPv4
            -- Service Type: 8 bits, used to specify details about quality of service, or QoS, technologies
            -- Total Length Field: 16 bits, indicates the total length of the IP datagram it's attached to.
            -- Identification field: 16-bit number that's used to group messages together
                    Note:-- The maximum size of a single datagram is the largest number you can represent with
                            16 bits: 65,535. If the total amount of data that needs to be sent is larger than what can fit in a
                            single datagram, the IP layer needs to split this data up into many individual packets.
                -- Used to identify packets from the same transmission as each will have value in this field

            -- Flags:
                -- Similar to the fragment Offset field, used ot indicate is a datagram is allowed to be fragmented, or to indicate that 
                    the datgram has already been fragmented. 
                -- NOTE: Fragmentation: Is the process of taking a single IP datagram and splitting it up into several smaller datagram.
            -- Fragment Offset:
                -- used by the receving end to put back fragmented datagram together.
            -- TTL:
                -- Time to Live(TTL): an 8-bit field that indicates how many router hops a datagram can transverse before it's
                    thrown away. Here routers will decrement this field value till it reaches zero then further transmissions of the datagram is stopped.
            -- Protocol:
                -- 8-bit field that contains data about what transport layer protocol is being used such as TCP or UDP
            -- Header Checksum:
                -- An checksum of the contents of the entire IP datagram header
            -- Source IP Address:
                -- 32 bits long
            -- Destination IP Address:
                -- 32 bits long
            -- Options:
                -- An optional field and is used to set special characteristics for datagram primarily used
                    for testing purposes.
            -- Padding:
                -- A series of zeros used to ensure the header is the correct total size.

    - Subnetting:
        -- THe process of taking a large network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks, or subnets.
        -- 
    - Subnet Masks
        -- Core Routers only care about the network ID
        -- Gateway Routers use the host ID to send the received packets to the right machine
        -- Subnet Masks are used to identify machines on a subnet
            -- Subnet masks: are 32-bit numbers that are normally written out as four octets in decimal
            -- A subnet mask defines which chunk of an IP address is the host ID and which portion is the subnet network ID. 
               This trick is accomplished using a subnet mask, another 32-bit number. A subnet mask works like a filter with 
               the mask identifying the IP address bits that represent the network ID with a 1, and the bits that represent the host ID with a 0. 
               The more host bits you have, the more devices that can connect to your subnet at the expense of the total number of sub networks you can set up, and visa-versa.

            -- NOTE: The function of a subnet mask is to extract the network ID portion of an IP destination address and determine 
               whether an IP address exists on the local network or whether it must be routed outside the local network. 
               If the extracted network ID matches the local network ID, the destination is located on the local network. 
               However, if they don\u2019t match, the message must be routed outside the local network. The process used to apply 
               the subnet mask involves Boolean algebra to filter out nonmatching bits. 

        -- The purpose of the Subnet mask is to tell the router what part of the IP Address is the Subnet ID.
            -- The numbers in the remaining octet that have a corresponding '1' is the subnet ID, and the ones with corresponding '0' is the host ID.

        -- Subnet Mask example:

                    255    .    255   .    255   .   224
                  11111111   11111111   1111111     11100000 >> Has only 5 bits of host id space OR 32 addresses

                    Hence the IP address 9.100.100.100 can translated into 9.100.100.100/27 with the above subnet mask
