 ---------------[EDB: External Data Bus]----
   Get the information using the add from MCC
   and pass it to CPU

Instruction Set:
    - Set of instructions used by the CPU to carry out certain basic
    functions.
    - Hard coded into CPU

CPU Socket configurations:
    - Land Grid Array (LGA):

    - Pin Grid Array(PGA):

        - SDRAM: Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory:- synchronized to system clock speed
        - DDR SDRAM: double data rate SDRAM: Faster, uses less power, 

Motherboards:
    - Conponents:
        - Chipset: South Bridge [ IO devices like hard drives and USB devices],  and North Bridge [Video Cards and RAM]
        - helps in the management of data between the RAM, CPU and peripherals
    - Expansion slots:
        - helps to increase the functionality of the conputer; 
            - Expansion Bus

        - ATX: Advanced Technology eXtended
        - ITX: Information Technology eXtended

Storage:
    - 1 bit
    - 8 bits -> 1 byte (B)
    - 1,024 bytes -> 1 kilobyte (KB) or 1 KebiByte (KiB)
    - 1,024 kb -> 1 megabyte (MB)
    - 1,024 megabytes -> 1 gigabyte (GB)
    - 1,024 gigabtyes -> 1 terabyte (TB)
    -Types:
        - HDD: Hard Disk Drive
        - SSD: Solid State Drive
    - Connectors: connectes our system to the harddrive
        - Serial ATA
        - NVMe or NVM express for SSD connections

Power Supplies:
    - DC: computers used this type of current.
    - Voltage: pushes electricity with no consideration on amount

        - Speed caculation:
            - 1 byte == 8 bits
                so to move 1MB of data in a second you need 8 Mb/s connection speed,
                hence 40MB data in a second ==> 320 Mb/s tranfer rate

What is Networking?
====================

Nerworking
 - The interconnection of computers is called a network.
 - The physical connection of computers and wires around the world is called the Internet.
 - The Web is the information on the Internet. We use the World Wide Web (WWW) to access the internet, and other applications such as
    emial, chat and file-sharing programs.

 - Building, managing and desgining networks is known as Networking.
 
Basics of Networking:

    - Structure of the internet:
                         
                                     |--------> Network Already setup
                                     |
        Internet <---> Servers <--> ISPs <---> Clients 

    - To connect to the internet your need an IP address
    - Devices that connect to the internet have both IP and MAC Address
    - Data is moved in packets that get reassembled at the destination

Networking Hardware:
    - Ways to connect a computer to the internet:
        -- ethernet cable
        -- wifi network
        -- fiber optic cables 

    - Router:
        -- Connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic
        -- 
    - Hub:
        -- sends data to everyone
    - Switches:
        -- Help data travel to right destination

    - Network Stack:
        -- A set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer.

Language of The Internet:
    - TCP: Transmission Control Protocol, ensures safe delivery of data from one network to another.
    - IP: Internet Protocol, ensures that data reaches the right destination in a network.

The Web:
    - www.reddit.com
       |    |     |
       |    |     v
            v  tells you what type of webpage the address belongs to    
        domain name
    - DNS: domain name system: translate computer IP to human readable form


Limitations of the Internet:
    - History of Internet
    - Limitations of the Internet:
        -- IPv4: 32bits into 4 groups e.g. 221.34.22.33
        -- IPv6: 128bits 
    - Network Address Translation (NAT):
        -- Lets organisations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network

    Impact of the Internet:
        - 

Introduction to Software:
    - Coding: Change one language to another
    - SCripting: is coding in a scripting language, usually used to perform a single- or limited-range task. 
    - Programming: coding in a programming language

Types of software:
    - Application: Created to fulfill a specific need, like a text editor, web browser, or graphic editor.
    - System software: used to kepp our core system running. like operating system tools and utilities.
    - Firmware: permanently stored on a computer component.
    - Software versions:
        -- alpha, beta, release 

Revisiting Abstraction:

    - Makes complex system simple

Recipe for Computer:
    - Assembler:> change to machine code
    - Compiler:> change to machine code
    - Interpreter:> interpret and run

Interacting with Software:

Troubleshooting Best Practices:
    - Ask questions
    - isolate the problem 
    -
