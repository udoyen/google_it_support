Once a threat has been detected and
contained, it has to be removed or remediated. When it comes to malware infection, this means removing the malware
from affected systems. But in some cases,
this may not be possible, so the affected systems have to be
restored to a known good configuration. This can be done by rebuilding
the machine or restoring from backup. Take care when removing malware
from systems because some malware is designed to be very persistent, which
means it's resistant to being removed. But before we can start the recovery,
we have to contain the incident. This might involve shutting down affected
systems to prevent further damage or spread of an infection. On the flip side of that, affected systems
may just have network access removed to cut off any communication
with the compromised system. Again, the motivating factor here would be
to prevent the spread of any infection or to remove remote access to the system. The containment strategy varies depending
on the nature of the affected system. Let's say a critical piece of networking
infrastructure was compromised. A quick shutdown may not work since it
would impact other business operations. On top of that, removing networking access might trigger
fail safes in attack software or malware. Let's say a piece of malware is designed
to periodically check into a command and control server. Severing network communications with
the infected host might cause the malware to trigger a self destruct function
in an attempt to destroy evidence. Forensic analysis may need to
be done to analyze the attack. This is especially true when it
comes to a malware infection. In the case of forensic analysis, affected
machines might be investigated very closely to determine exactly
what the attacker did. This is usually done by
taking an image of the disk, essentially making a virtual
copy of the hard drive. This lets the investigator
analyze the contents of the disk without the risk of modifying or
altering the original files. If that happened, it would compromise
the integrity of any forensic evidence. Usually, evidence gathering is also
part of the incident response process. This provides evidences to law
enforcement if the organization wants to pursue legal action
against the attackers. Forensic evidence is super useful for providing details of the attack
to the security community. It allows others security teams
to be aware of new treats and lets them better defends themselves. It's also very important that you get
members from your legal team involved in any incident handling plans. Because an incident can have legal
implications for the company, a lawyer should be available to consult and advise
on the legal aspects of the investigation. It's crucial in order to avoid
complications or issues of liability. Members of the public relations
team should also get involved since these incidents can have
an impact on a company's reputation. There is another part of the cleanup and
recovery phase I should call out. We'll need to use information
from the analysis to prevent any further intrusions or
infections. First, we determine the entry point to
figure out how the attacker got in, or what vulnerability the malware exploited. This needs to be done at
the same time as the cleanup. If you remove the malware infection
without also addressing the underlying vulnerability, systems could become
reinfected right after you clean them up. As you learned in the system
administration and IT infrastructure services course, postmortems can be
a great way to document incidents. The learnings from postmortems can
be used to prevent those incidents from happening again. If a critical system has been compromised, remediation can be complicated because of
downtime during remediation and recovery. Logs have to be audited to determine
exactly what the attacker did while they had access to the system. They'll also tell you what
data the attacker accessed. Systems must be scrutinized to ensure
no back doors have been installed, or malware planted on the system. Depending on the severity
of the compromise or infection, it might be necessary to
rebuild the system from the ground up. Cleanup would typically involve
restoring from a backup point to a known good configuration. Infected or corrupted system files could
be restored from known good copies. Sometimes, cleanup can be very simple and
quick. I hope that's what you
find more often than not. If a website was defaced, the attacker
may have simply uploaded their defaced HTML file and
pointed the web server at the new file. A configuration file change and deletion of the attacker's HTML
file would undo those changes. Even so, efforts need to be made to
determine how the attacker got access. That vulnerability should be closed
to prevent any future attacks. When all traces of the attack have
been removed and discovered and the known vulnerabilities have been
closed, you can move on to the last step. That's when systems need to be thoroughly
tested to make sure proper functionality has been restored. Usually, affected systems would
also remain under close watch, sometimes with additional detailed
monitoring and logging enabled. This is to watch for
any additional signs of an intrusion in case something was
missed during the cleanup. It's also possible that the attacker will
attempt to attack the same target again. There's a very high chance
that they use the same or similar attack methodology on
other targets in your network. It's important to incorporate the lessons
you've learned from any incident into your overall security defenses. Update firewall rules and ACLs if an exposure was discovered
in the course of the investigation. Create new definitions and rules for
intrusion detections systems that can watch for
the signs of the same attack again. Stay vigilant and prepared to
protect your system from attacks. Remember that at some point,
some sort of security breach will happen. Just stay calm and execute your
plan to counterattack the breach.
