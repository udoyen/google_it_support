Defense in depth is the concept of having multiple overlapping systems of defense to protect IT systems. This ensures some amount of redundancy for defensive measures. It also helps avoid a catastrophic compromise in the event that a single system fails, or a vulnerability is discovered in one system. Think of this as having multiple lines of defense. If an attacker manages to bypass your firewall, you're still protected by strong authentication systems within the network. This would require an attacker to find more vulnerabilities in more systems before real damage can occur. These next lessons will focus on bringing together the different security systems and measures we've discussed so far into a comprehensive security design. It'll offer defense in depth from a variety of known and unknown threats. By the end of this course, you'll be able to implement the appropriate methods for system hardening and application hardening. You'll also be able to determine the policies to use for operating system security. All right, let's get started.
